# TheBirger-INDEEDCOMSCRAPER

The Birger is a Indeed.com scraper with a simplistic and easy-to-use GUI that I made for it, you can choose how many pages it'll scrape, and once it's done it'll save to an Excel file.

It will scrape the employer & the job title ofcourse. It will scrape until the break page you input at the start, that's how it looks when it's finished, it'll save the Excel file to the directory the software is.
Here's the look. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0sRqKaB.png"> </img>

It's a very simple design, but it works great, and very easy for the user to use.
